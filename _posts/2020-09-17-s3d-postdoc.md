We recently got a new NSF grant on spatial sound scene description, and thus we need a new postdoc at the [NYU Music and Audio Research Lab](https://steinhardt.nyu.edu/marl).

While the postdoc is primarily focused on single + multi-modal self-supervised learning and joint localization + detection of sound events, we will also be researching novel methods for interactive audio annotation.

Deadline is October 15.
