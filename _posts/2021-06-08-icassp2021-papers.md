We have two new papers at ICASSP 2021 this year:
- ["Few-Shot Continual Learning for Audio Classification"](/publications/2021-06-08-wang2021continual) led by [Yu Wang](https://y-wang.weebly.com/). This paper investigates how to expand the vocabulary of an existing audio tagging model when you only have a few examples of the new class. It will be [presented at ICASSP on June 9, 3:30 - 4:15PM (EDT)](https://ieeeicassp-virtual.org/presentation/poster/fewshot-continual-learning-audio-classification#edit-group-tab-details).
- ["Specialized Embedding Approximation for Edge Intelligence: A Case Study in Urban Sound Classification"](/publications/2021-06-08-srivastava2021specialized) led by Sangeeta Srivastava. This paper investigates compressing an audio embedding network using knowledge distillation to a specialized target domain. It will be [presented at ICASSP on June 9, 2:00 - 2:45PM (EDT)](https://ieeeicassp-virtual.org/presentation/poster/specialized-embedding-approximation-edge-intelligence-case-study-urban-sound).
