abstract: "This report presents the design and construction of Rage in Conjunction with the Machine, a simple but novel pairing of musical interface and sound sculpture. The authors discuss the design and creation of this instrument, focusing on the unique aspects of it, including the use of physical systems, large gestural input, scale, and the electronic coupling of a physical input to a physical output."
