abstract: "It is common for the teacher&#8217;s understanding of a concept to evolve and change as they teach. This is especially common for creative tasks&#8212;preferred goals and methods can and should shift during the creative process. This can be problematic for interactively training a machine learning system to assist a creative task. Algorithms typically presume a constant goal and treat inconsistency in training data as unwanted noise. &#8220;Creative types&quot; typically don&#8217;t understand the internals of learning algorithms and cannot compensate for the weakness of the algorithms. We must develop methods better able to handle training data that represents a shifting goal or concept. Ideally, these approaches should incorporate a training paradigm that even novice, non-technical users can use effectively."
