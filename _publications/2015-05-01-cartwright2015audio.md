abstract: "To effectively utilize and collaborate with audio production tools, users (especially novices) must be able to communicate their ideas in the ways that work well for them. However, many artists&apos; preferred means of interaction are not well aligned with the interfaces of most audio production software. The resulting mismatch can disrupt the flow of ideas and inhibit creativity. A new approach to interface design is required."
