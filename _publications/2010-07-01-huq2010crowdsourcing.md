abstract: "Systems able to find a song based on a sung, hummed, or whistled melody are called Query-By-Humming (QBH) systems. Tunebot is an online QBH web service and iPhone app that connects users to the desired recording on Amazon.com or iTunes. Tunebot&#8217;s searchable database is composed of thousands of usercontributed melodies. Melodies are collected from user queries, sung contributions and through contributions from on-line play of an associated iPhone Karaoke game: Karaoke Callout. In this paper we describe the architecture and workings of the paired systems, as well as issues involved in building a real-world, working music search engine from user-contributed data."
