abstract: "Synthesizer programming interfaces are usually complex, discouraging novice users from exploring timbres outside the confines of &quot;factory presets&quot;. This paper presents an alternative approach to synthesizer interfaces to enable novices to quickly find their target sound in the large, generative timbre spaces of synthesizers, while also allowing for exploration."
