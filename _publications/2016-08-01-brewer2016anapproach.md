abstract: "Older adults and people with vision impairments are increasingly using phones to receive audio-based information and want to publish content online but must use complex audio recording/editing tools that often rely on inaccessible graphical interfaces. This poster describes the design of an accessible audio-based interface for post-processing audio content created by visually impaired seniors. We conducted a diary study with five older adults with vision impairments to understand how to design a system that would allow them to edit content they record using an audio-only interface. Our findings can help inform the development of accessible audio-editing interfaces for people with vision impairments more broadly."
